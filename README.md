# BAYESIAN-LEARNING-AND-MONTECARLO-SIMULATION

Principles of Bayesian learning. Quantifying uncertainty using probabilities. Likelihood, prior and posterior distributions: Bayesâ€™ Theorem for learning from data. Bayesian estimation and hypothesis testing. Posterior mean and variance, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, posterior intervals, prediction, Bayes factor.
Basic models. Bayesian learning for proportions (Bernoulli model- Beta prior). Inference for mean and variance in normal model (Normal Gamma prior). Inference for count data (Poisson model Gamma prior). Generalizations: conjugate priors. Statistical Computing. Introduction to R software for Bayesian analysis. Monte Carlo Methods. Why sampling methods are needed: intractable integrals and sums. Monte Carlo integration. Importance sampling. Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Practical examples and implementation in R and JAGS. More complex models. A selection among these subjects: mixture of normal distributions and clustering (Expectation Maximization, Gibbs sampling), Bayesian linear regression models, classification (naive Bayes). Basics of Bayesian reliability models. Practical examples using JAGS. Applications to real data. Electrical load forecasting and electricity demand, Bayesian optimization for efficient uncertainty quantification in complex electrical/electronic systems.
